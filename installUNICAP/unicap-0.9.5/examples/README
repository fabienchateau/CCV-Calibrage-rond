This directory contains examples for 'libunicap' and 'libunicapgtk'. 


** INSTALLATION **

 Before you can build any example, you have to build 'libunicap' first. 
 Most examples come with a simple 'Makefile' and use 'pkg-config' to find their libraries. 
 If 'pkg-config' complains that it can not find a specific library, you will have to set 
 the 'PKG_CONFIG_PATH' variable to the path where the 'libunicap.pc' got installed. This 
 should be '/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig' per default. 

 The 'xv_display' example comes in it's own "xv_display*.tar.gz" archive and has it's own 
 'configure' script. This script will look for all required X11 and unicap libraries. 


** EXAMPLES **

Below is a short description of ( hopefully ) each example: 

device_info: 
	Enumerates all devices found by unicap and prints out all supported video 
	formats and properties of each device. 

raw_image: 
	Opens the first device found by unicap, captures one frame with the default video 
	format of this device and outputs the captured data to stdout.

sdl_display: 
	Prompts the user for a video capture device and video format. Then it starts capturing 
	from this device and displays the captured data using a SDL YUV overlay. 

	Currently only UYVY formats are supported by this example. 

sdl_image_saving:
	Saves images from the live stream to .jpg files using "jpeglib". 
	Click on the video window to save an image.

xv_display: 
	Works like the SDL example but uses the Xv extension to display the video data. 

	Again only UYVY formats are supported. 

unicapgtk_simple: 
	Shows the use of the videodisplay widget of 'libunicapgtk'. Creates a GTK window and 
	displays a live video from the first capture device found by unicap. 

unicapgtk_cb: 
	Shows the use of callbacks with 'libunicapgtk'. Creates a GTK window and captures data
	from the first capture device found by unicap. For each captured frame it inverts the 
	first half of the image data before this data gets displayed. 

unicapgtk_smallapp: 
	Shows the use of the deviceproperty widget of 'libunicapgtk'. Shows a live video 
	from the first capture device found by unicap and presents a set of controls to 
	adjust the properties for this device.
