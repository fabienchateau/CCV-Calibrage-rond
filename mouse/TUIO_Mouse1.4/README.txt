This software is part of reacTIVision, an open source fiducial
tracking and multi-touch framework based on computer vision.

Usage :
-------
On most platforms you can start the application just by double-clicking the TuioMouse.jar file.
If you want to specify an alternative TUIO port or start the application from the command line,
just type: java -jar TuioMouse.jar [port]
substitute [port] with the desired port number.
The application will run in the background without any GUI.

TuioMouse will use the first available TuioCursor as the principal mouse pointer.
Additional TuioCursor ADD and REMOVE events are treated as mouse button PRESS and RELEASE events.

TuioTouchpad behaves like a notebook touchpad by interpreting 
the cursor velocity as relative displacements.
